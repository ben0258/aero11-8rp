# Aero11-8rp
An edit of Aero11 Metro with the titlebar buttons from Windows 8 build 8102, and the Explorer navigation buttons from Windows 8 Build 8400. 

This was an edit that I made for myself, but I decided to share it online.

Based on, and probably requires, [SandTechStuff's Aero11 Metro theme.](https://github.com/SandTechStuff/Aero11/tree/aero11_metro)
